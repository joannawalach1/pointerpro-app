          Let's talk about structured questions and why they are so important.
          💡 As a consultant, structured questions are extremely important. They
          help you understand the problem that customers are trying to solve.
          Also, in Sales, having structured questions is essential. Imagine
          being on a sales call, and your interlocutor immediately starts with
          the sales pitch. You would be out, right? The structure of the
          questions in a sales call is critical. You never jump in head first.
          You should always try to connect with your customer by asking
          questions to gain some background info. This leads to a better
          understanding of where they're coming from and the task or problem
          they have. This as well can help in creating a framework. This is also
          applicable when creating a questionnaire. The more you create
          structure and a logical flow, the easier it is for the respondent to
          complete the task. And this usually leads to a higher response rate to
          your questionnaire. You can listen to the Innovation meets
          leadership-podcast 🔊 to find out more about the importance of
          listening to customers, taking action, and outcome-based innovation.
          Lots of listening pleasure!

          You probably already know that the questions you ask in your
          assessment or survey can make or break the whole thing. 💡But did you
          also know you should never end your questionnaire with the following
          words: "Thank you for participating!"? Want to know why? Take a listen
